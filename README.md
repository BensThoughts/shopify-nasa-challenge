# Shopify Nasa Challenge

My challenge project for the shopify remote front end developer position (2022).

Beautiful images from NASA infinitely scrolled. Sometimes the NASA APOD API is
slow, give it a minute.

[Live Demo](https://shopify-nasa-challenge.netlify.app/)

## Getting Started Locally

First clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/BensThoughts/shopify-nasa-challenge
```

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
